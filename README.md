# Hoarding-in-CPP
A game of Monopoly with a text interface, that allows for multiple players and adjusting of rule sets, as well as importing of varied "board" files to mix things up.

Arguments are passed in in the following format:

[RulesFile.txt] [BoardFile.csv] [RandomDiceSet.txt]


Example line to feed into CMD:

/home/kodethon/InstrSol/Rules/OneMoveRules.txt /home/kodethon/InstrSol/Boards/FreeParkingOnly.csv /home/kodethon/InstrSol/RandomFiles/All3s.txt

Sample rules files, board files, and dice files will be committed to the repository shortly.
