# Hoarding-in-CPP
A game of Monopoly with a text interface, that allows for multiple players and adjusting of rule sets, as well as importing of varied "board" files to mix things up.

Arguments are passed in in the following format:

[RulesFile.txt] [BoardFile.csv] [RandomDiceSet.txt]


Example line to feed into CMD:

/home/kodethon/InstrSol/Rules/OneMoveRules.txt /home/kodethon/InstrSol/Boards/FreeParkingOnly.csv /home/kodethon/InstrSol/RandomFiles/All3s.txt

Of note, some files are headed by "created by MFButner on x/xx/xxxx" - This was the inititialization of the file upon the inception of the project, and was no more than a labeled file and initilized names of functions. All written code is done by either myself, or my partner, Max Flyyn.
